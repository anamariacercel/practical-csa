# CSA Implementation

This is a implementation of a modified Connection Scan Algorithm.
Modifications are made to fit special requirements for timetable information systems at [Deutsche Bahn](http://deutschebahn.com).

## About the algorithm

The algorithm was introduced in 2013 by [Julian Dibbelt, Thomas Pajor, Ben Strasser, and Dorothea Wagner](http://i11www.iti.uni-karlsruhe.de/extra/publications/dpsw-isftr-13.pdf).

## About the project

My bachelor thesis studies the relevance and applicability of the algorithm for [Deutsche Bahn](http://deutschebahn.com).
This repository contains code that was created for the thesis.
